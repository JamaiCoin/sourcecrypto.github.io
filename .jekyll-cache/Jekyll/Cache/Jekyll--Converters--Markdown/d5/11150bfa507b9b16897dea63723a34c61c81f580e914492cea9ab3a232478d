I"E<p>“My name is Daniel Hardman,  I work with Hyperledger Indy project. I’m going to talk about some concepts that have been marinating in my mind and in the minds of some people that I work with for quite a while. Not all these ideas are originally mine.<br /><br />
Microledger’s and edge-chains: I’m going to demystify that, and when you walk away I hope you’re gonna think of this as not so much a super technical session that you’ve been to but instead a session that kind of has some intriguing ideas for you to think about later in whatever you’re doing.”</p>
