I"å<p><strong>A discord server and web-portal for creating an open-source, public-domain, index of Crypto Knowledge.</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://discord.gg/ahTuPMY">Source Crypto Discord Chat</a> is a landing pad.. I drop links there on the fly, occasionaly exporting and publishing the <a href="/archive/">channels</a> here. The next step is to systematically build better, more organized resources with the server as a starting point.</p>

<p>The aim is to generally map out the history and knowledge related to Bitcoin and blockchain in general.</p>

<p>There is so much to learn about, I mostly manage to avoid thinking about scammy stuff and icos, and really whatever you are hyped about, I probably donâ€™t care. So the application section is in rough shape.. I donâ€™t spend a lot of time there. Tech, History, Development, Webwork. I care about real web technologies.</p>

<p>So, little by little, those un-organized pages will grow to become each a formidible resource of its own.</p>

<p>While I do intend to build custom pages for most of these channels, being able to simply export the entire discord server and publish it is excellent.</p>

<p><a href="https://discord.gg/ahTuPMY"><strong>Sourceâ§‰Crypto Discord server</strong></a> - I collect and categorize links in here, on the fly.

<p>Previously, I was putting information in TOML format. Then, after I started to learn GitHub pages, and working with some other people on a similar project for Decentralized Identity, I realized that GitHub Pages \ Jekyll have built-in support for yaml, csv, and jsonâ€¦ but I havenâ€™t really gotten so far as figuring that out.</p>

<p>Recently, I found <a href="https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter/">Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter</a> which quickly turned the entire contents of Source Crypto Discord Server into 170+ html files.</p>

<p>Then, I used minimal-mistakes collections feature to quickly publish the lot of them, using VSCode to easily edit all of the files at the same time.</p>

<p>I cut out the head of each of the files and injected the css to be applied to those pages.</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s a super quick way to get all that content up here on the web where anyone can access it more easily.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/sourcecrypto/sourcecrypto.github.io">sourcecrypto/sourcecrypto.github.io</a> -  Now I have a few complete and proper toml files converted to json that I can use to experiment with generating pages - listing by title, tag, and incorporating search functionality, or perhaps filter by user-input.</p>
