  <p>Smart contracts are self-executing code that defines and executes an agreement between multiple parties. That code contains simple ‚Äúif/when‚Ä¶then‚Ä¶‚Äù statements executed within a distributed network that achieves consensus on transactions made within it.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>The capability paradigm is about access control. When a system, such as an OS or a website, is presented with a request for a service it provides, it needs to decide if it should actually do what the requestor is asking for. The way it decides is what we‚Äôre talking about when we talk about access control. If you‚Äôre like most people, the first thing you‚Äôre likely to think of is to ask the requestor ‚Äúwho are you?‚Äù The fundamental insight of the capabilities paradigm is to recognize that this question is the first step on the road to perdition. That‚Äôs highly counterintuitive to most people, hence the related controversy.</p>

          <p>I‚Äôm always astounded by the depth to which Mark has explored this space. On more than a few occasions, I‚Äôve come up with an interesting idea for a new protocol or programming language feature or piece of distributed systems infrastructure and told Mark about it, only to find he had already thought of that problem and discovered and solved several issues I hadn‚Äôt even thought about yet.</p>

          <p>Cap‚Äôn Proto RPC <a href="https://capnproto.org/rpc.html">https://capnproto.org/rpc.html</a> is based on E‚Äôs network protocol, CapTP, e.g. utilizing The Four Tables:</p>

          <p>(You can think of this design as an extension of the file descriptor table concept in Unix, except that both sides may export descriptors to the other side (so that calls can flow either way), and either side can be responsible for assigning the numeric descriptor value for any particular description (which makes it easier to compensate for a high-latency transport).)</p>

          <p>When I first told Mark I was working on an object-oriented RPC protocol, he insisted I visit him and listen while he explained all this to me, and boy am I glad he did‚Ä¶ would have taken a lot longer for me to figure it out myself.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>By the original design bitcoins are fungible, acting as a neutral medium of exchange. However, by carefully tracking the origin of a given bitcoin, it is possible to ‚Äúcolor‚Äù a set of bitcoins to distinguish it from the rest. These bitcoins can then have special properties supported by either an issuing agent or by public agreement, and have value independent of the face value of the underlying bitcoins. Such colored bitcoins can be used for alternative currencies, commodity certificates, smart property, and other financial instruments such as stocks and bonds.</p>

      <p>Because colored coins make use of the existing Bitcoin infrastructure and can be stored and transferred without the need for a third party, and even be exchanged for one another in an atomic transaction, they can open the way for the decentralized exchange of things that are not possible by traditional methods. In this paper we will discuss the implementation details of colored coins and some of their use cases.</p>

And it kind of came over time.</p>

      <p>The first thing I did was I made a proposal to Mastercoin that would replace basically five of the transaction types they have with a programming language designed to express financial contracts between two parties. So you could do binary options, contracts for different bets‚Äî</p>
