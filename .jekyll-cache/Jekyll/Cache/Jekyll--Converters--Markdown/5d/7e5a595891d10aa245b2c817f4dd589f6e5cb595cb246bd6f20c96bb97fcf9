    <blockquote>
      <p>The semantics are defined for a number of meta-instructions which perform operations essential to the writing of programs in multiprogrammed computer systems. These meta-instructions relate to parallel processing, protection of separate computations, program debugging, and the sharing among users of memory segments and other computing objects, the names of which are hierarchically structured. The language sophistication contemplated is midway between an assembly language and an advanced algebraic language.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>The capability paradigm is about access control. When a system, such as an OS or a website, is presented with a request for a service it provides, it needs to decide if it should actually do what the requestor is asking for. The way it decides is what we‚Äôre talking about when we talk about access control. If you‚Äôre like most people, the first thing you‚Äôre likely to think of is to ask the requestor ‚Äúwho are you?‚Äù The fundamental insight of the capabilities paradigm is to recognize that this question is the first step on the road to perdition. That‚Äôs highly counterintuitive to most people, hence the related controversy.</p>

      <p>Then, my thesis supervisor said ‚ÄúBut you‚Äôre wrong, Erlang is extremely object oriented‚Äù. He said object oriented languages aren‚Äôt object oriented. I might think, though I‚Äôm not quite sure if I believe this or not, but Erlang might be the only object oriented language because the 3 tenets of object oriented programming are that it‚Äôs based on message passing, that you have isolation between objects and have polymorphism.</p>
